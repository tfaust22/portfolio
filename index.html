    <h2> Philosophy Statement</h2>

    <p>As a former educator, I bring a strong philosophy of supporting and serving others into the field of librarianship. I believe that everybody has the right to research, study, read, and learn anything that intrigues thems. My goal is to continue helping others by meeting their needs to fulfill their interests.</p>
