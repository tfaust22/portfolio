                    <p>My friend, Taylor Cole, has recently created a podcast, which focuses on Rom-Com movies. The podcast analyzes the pros versus cons of Rom-Com films. I've been a guest speaker on the podcast a few times to discuss the positive messages behind the films. Take a listen to our current podcast episode, where we dissect the film, Mean Girls.</p>

                    <p>As a life-long avid reader, I created a book-focused <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bookish_trish/">Instagram</a> to connect with other readers and authors. I enjoy reading reviews, seeing what others are reading, and learning about upcoming releases from favorite authors. Feel free to check out my account and find a new read!</p>

                        <p>This budgeting exercise tested my abilities to create a program budget and justify the purchases based on the given line-item budget and some general information given about the information organization. I was given freedom to identify the type of information organization I was running for the assignment as well as the mission statement, goals and objective, and items to be purchased.</p>
